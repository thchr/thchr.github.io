# Connectivity tables (w/o time-reversal symmetry)

The tables below give the minimum band connectivity, νᵀ, of transverse photonic bands required by symmetry *without* the presence of time-reversal symmetry.
See the [time-reversal invariant tables](/notes/connectivities) for context and notational details.
