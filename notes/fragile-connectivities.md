# Fragile topology tables

The tables below include classification of trivial/fragile/strong topology in the case where the singular irreps at Γ "continued" to a regular irrep (i.e. all symmetry eigenvalues can be inferred from **k** lines incident onto Γ, and the irrep derived from these symmetry eigenvalues is regular).

The connectivies νᵀ and symmetry vectors are the same as those given in the general tables](connectivities.md), but the regularity of the Γ-irrep allow a more refined analysis of the associated topology.

**Notes:**

1.  (▪)²ᵀ denotes the singular Γ-symmetry content of the 2T plane waves connected to $ω=0$, whether regular or irregular.

2.  Of the 230 space groups, only 68 have "regular" Γ-irreps at ω=0. 
    Of these 68 space groups, only 29 *may* host symmetry-identified fragile phases: we include only these 29 space groups here.

3.  Time-reversal symmetry is assumed.
