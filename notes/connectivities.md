# Connectivity tables (w/ time-reversal symmetry)

The tables below give the minimum band connectivity, νᵀ, of transverse photonic bands required by symmetry.
In addition, for the minimal connectivity solution, the associated symmetry vectors are indicated as well.

For the space groups with nontrivial symmetry indicator groups, the topology of the symmetry vectors are also indicated (obtained as the "xor"-difference of the 2T+1L and the 1L solutions).

**Notes:**

1.  (▪)\T denotes the singular Γ-symmetry content of the 2T plane waves connected to $ω=0$, whether regular or irregular.

2.  The ~~~2<sup>nd</sup>~~~ minimal solutions were skipped for SGs 2, 10, and 47 due to excessive execution time.

3.  Time-reversal symmetry is assumed (see the corresponding [time-reversal broken tables](/notes/connectivities-broken-tr)).
