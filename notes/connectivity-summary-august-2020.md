## Tables of band connectivities

Detailed tables [here](/notes/connectivities) including characterization of (non-fragile) topology (minimal and "2ⁿᵈ" minimal connectivity solutions).

## Nodal lines
I looked through about 400 distinct random lattices in both SG 68 and 86, finding several handfuls of lattices with νᵀ = 2 (along high-symmetry lines).
I then picked the lattices with largest gap to the third band and calculated the dispersion in the entire BZ: from that, I extracted nodal lines from frequency difference between bands 2 and 3 (as isosurfaces around a small threshold value; hence, each line has a finite "width").

- 
    **SG 68** (νᵀ = 2 is guaranteed nontrivial): 
    According to \cite{Song:2018}, the minimal nodal structure should be 4 closed loops that intersect the BZ, and carry Z₂ monopole charge.
    What I found (tested in two lattices) was 4 nodal lines that go across the BZ (along *z*). 
    I'm having a bit of trouble reconciling these differences: my reading of Song's PRX is there is nothing that protects a nodal line crossing through $k_z = 0$; on the other hand, I guess there also isn't anything that would forbid it?
    One other thing: how would one conceive of the Z₂ monopole charge if the nodal line isn't "closed locally" (i.e. spans the BZ)? There's no way to put a sphere around the line.

- 
    **SG 86** (νᵀ = 2 is guaranteed nontrivial):
    Pretty much same story, except Song's PRX predicts the minimal configuration to cross $k_z=0$, as it also does here. Seems fully consistent.

 - 
    **SGs 48 & 50** (also guaranteed nontrivial at νᵀ = 2): didn't explore - I'm thinking two examples of this is plenty.



## Time-reversal breaking

- 
    In almost all the space groups, any reduction of νᵀ by time-reversal (TR) symmetry is factor of two or four. We discussed that it might be more interesting to showcase an example where this isn't the case. Thinking about it now, I'm not actually too sure of how that is much more appealing. Thoughts?
    
-
    In any case, one good example could be SG 87 where νᵀ is reduced from 3 to 2 under TR-breaking. We can break TR in  SG 87 while preserving the spatial symmetries by applying a magnetic field along $\hat{\mathbf{z}}$, which then drives a magneto-optic/gyromagnetic/Faraday effect 
    $$
        \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\rv) = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon'(\rv) & ig_z(\rv) & 0 \\ -ig_z(\rv) & \varepsilon'(\rv) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \varepsilon'(\rv) \end{bmatrix}
    $$
-   with $g_z(\rv) \equiv \chi^m(\rv)H_z$ where $\chi^m(\rv)$ and $\varepsilon'(\rv)$ have the full symmetry of SG 87.

-   I haven't done this yet, but it should be easy enough: I'll start by finding a TR-symmetric case with νᵀ = 3.

## SG 72

-
    Except for SG 72, νᵀ is always an integer (or unit) multiple of \cite{Watanabe:2018}'s bound. For SG 72, however, our prediction is νᵀ = 4 while the WL bound was 3. 
    In my notes, I can see we discussed this case briefly, noting that SGs 72 could be thought of as belonging to the set of SGs from 71 to 74 (νᵀ₇₁ = 3, νᵀ₇₂ = 4, νᵀ₇₃ = 4 and νᵀ₇₄ = 2), which are all in body-centered orthorhombic (oI) and are generated by inversion and two-fold rotation or screw axes.
    
    Right now, I can't quite see the appeal of investigating this in closer detail?

## SG 230: M=8 or M=12?
- 
    I computed the band dispersion for ~2.600 distinct dielectric lattices in SG 230 (along high-symmetry lines): unfortunately, none of these lattices had $M<12$.
    As context, this required around 1.300 CPU hours ≈ 50+ CPU days.
    
- 
    I've manually checked *one* of the four $M=8$ solutions by comparing its compatibility relations to the pinned outgoing lines from Γ. The solution is completely kosher and consistent.
    The four solutions are: (▪²ᵀ denotes the singular $ω=0$ bands)

    1. [▪²ᵀ+Γ₁⁻+Γ₂⁺+Γ₂⁻+Γ₄⁻, H₁+H₄, 2P₃, 3N₁+N₂]
    2. [▪²ᵀ+Γ₁⁺+Γ₂⁺+Γ₂⁻+Γ₄⁺, H₁+H₄, 2P₃, 3N₁+N₂]
    3. [▪²ᵀ+Γ₁⁺+Γ₁⁻+Γ₂⁻+Γ₅⁻, H₁+H₄, 2P₃, 2N₁+2N₂]
    4. [▪²ᵀ+Γ₁⁺+Γ₁⁻+Γ₂⁺+Γ₅⁺, H₁+H₄, 2P₃, 2N₁+2N₂]

- 
    If you have the time, it'd be great if you could check one as well: just to verify that we agree on this point.

- 
    My current thinking about this is that the M=8 configurations could simply be energetically very unfavorable: even if it is possible symmetry-wise to realize $M=8$, there could still be energetic barriers that make it challenging or practically impossible. 
    One thing I haven't explored, but which could perhaps offer additional "tuning knobs" is to utilize dispersive materials to realize an $M=8$ configuration (e.g., metamaterial/plasmonic crystals).

## SG 68: previously unable to find expansion for higher-order bands:
- 
    We previously discussed a particular case in SG 68 that had two bands connected to ω=0, then a gap, then 8 connected bands, then a gap, etc. When we discussed this, I was unable to find an expansion for the 8 bands: since these bands should be regular, this was somewhat of a conundrum. 

    The reason was rather banal: I had accidentally misaligned the sorting of irreps in the symmetry vector and the sorting of irreps in the Hilbert basis. After aligning the sorting, the problem was fixed (and the 8 bands were found to be topologically nontrivial; consistent with our expectations, since the 2 bottom bands were nontrivial by our previous analysis).
