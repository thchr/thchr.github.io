# Hiring

I'm Thomas Christensen, a research scientist in Prof. Marin Soljačić lab at MIT. I'm starting a research team at the Technical University of Denmark in the Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering in early 2023 and am looking for excellent, motivated, and driven PhD students and postdocs to pursue new directions in photonic topology.

See my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4e0JL34AAAAJ&hl) and list of publications for examples of research activities.
