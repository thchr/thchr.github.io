I'm Thomas Christensen, a research scientist in Prof.~~~&nbsp~~~Marin Soljačić lab at MIT.

I'm starting a research team in early 2023 at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://electro.dtu.dk/) in the Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering, DTU Electro.

I'm looking for excellent and motivated PhD students and postdocs to pursue exciting directions at the intersection between symmetry analysis and photonic topology.

**If that's you, please reach out by email** ([tchr@mit.edu](tchr@mit.edu)) and have a look at the [PhD](https://efzu.fa.em2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/da/sites/CX_1/job/1429/?utm_medium=jobshare) and [postdoc](https://efzu.fa.em2.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1/job/1428/?utm_medium=jobshare) job postings! 

For examples of activities, see the [research](research/index) and [publications](publications/index) pages.
