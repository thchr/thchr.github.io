I'm Thomas Christensen, a research scientist in Prof. Marin Soljačić lab at MIT.

I'm starting a team at the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english) in the [Department of Electrical and Photonics Engineering](https://electro.dtu.dk/) in early 2023 and am looking for excellent, motivated, and driven PhD students and postdocs to pursue new directions in photonic topology. If that's you, please reach out by email (tchr@mit.edu).
