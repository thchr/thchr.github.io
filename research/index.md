# Research

I'm primarily working in theoretical and computational research - and interested in both fundamentals and applications - but always keeping an eye to opportunities for collaboration with experimentalist!

Examples of past and ongoing research directions include:

Past projects include topological phenomena in plasmonics systems ([PRL](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.245301) & [Nat. Commun.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12092-x)).
More recent projects include analysis of band connectivity and topology in 3D photonic crystals ([PRX](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.021066)), topology-optimization of photonic crystals ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16560)), and quasicrystalline Weyl points ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14299)).

Many of my more recent activities have been associated with development of symmetry-based methods. Several of the associated software tools are available as open-source software, implemented in the Julia programming language:

- [Crystalline.jl](https://github.com/thchr/Crystalline.jl): Space group theory, including complete irrep tables, subgroup relations, band representations, and group listings.
- [Brilllouin.jl](https://github.com/thchr/Brillouin.jl): High-symmetry paths in **k**-space for band structure calculation.
- [KdotP.jl](https://github.com/thchr/KdotP.jl): Symmetry-constrained derivation of **k**⋅**p** models in crystals.
- [Neumann.jl](https://github.com/thchr/Neumann.jl): Symmetry-allowed components of a response tensor.

For more examples of open-source software, see my [Github profile](https://github.com/thchr).

## Quantum response in plasmonics

At sufficiently small scales, on the order a few nanometers, the classical description of plasmonics breaks down and quantum mechanical effects become non-negligible.
Building upon work by Feibelman from the 70s and 80s, we introduced a new framework centered around surface response functions to incorporate effects like electron spill-out, nonlocality, and surface-assisted Landau damping ([PRL](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.157402) and [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1803-1)).
The tools have since found applications to questions in light-matter interaction ([Nat. Commun.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13820-z)) and acoustic graphene plasmons ([Nat. Commun.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23061-8)).

With collaborators in Prof. Soljačić's group, we've explored the application of neural networks to photonic crystals ([Nanophotonics](https://doi.org/10.1515/nanoph-2020-0197)); more recently, we used photonic crystals as a testbed for exploring novel approaches to transfer learning in science ([Nat. Commun.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31915-y)).
